# Text Editor App (Written in C)

Welcome to the **Text Editor App**, a simple yet functional text editor built using the C programming language. This project is part of a series of projects I'm working on to learn and explore the fundamentals of C programming.

## About

The goal of this text editor is to create a basic, user-friendly tool for editing text files.

### Features:
- Open and read text files.
- Edit the contents of the file.
- Save changes back to the file.
- Basic navigation with arrow keys.
- Clear and simple interface.

## Project Motivation

This project is part of my journey to learn C programming. I wanted to build a text editor from scratch to understand concepts such as:
- File I/O (Input/Output)
- Memory allocation and management
- Handling user input
- Implementing core algorithms for text manipulation

This project will grow over time as I learn more advanced topics in C and implement new features based on those learnings.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can:

- Open a file by typing its path after launching the program.
- Use the arrow keys to navigate the text.
- Edit the text as you would in any basic text editor.
- Press `Ctrl+S` to save your changes.
- Exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+Q`.
